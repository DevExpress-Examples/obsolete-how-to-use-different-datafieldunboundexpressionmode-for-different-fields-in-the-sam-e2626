⛔ DEPRECATED. Starting with v15.1, it is possible to set the [PivotGridField.UnboundExpressionMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.XtraPivotGrid.PivotGridFieldBase.UnboundExpressionMode) property to define the expression calculation mode for individual fields. The following modes are supported:
- `DataSource` - Values from an underlying data source are used to calculate the unbound field.
- `UseSummaryValues` - Summary values are used to calculate the unbound field.
- `UseAggregateFunctions` - Allows you to use aggregate functions on summary level unbound expression.

The current repository will not be updated in the future.
